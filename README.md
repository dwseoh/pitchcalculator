# Online Speedgun (Baseball)
This is a web app developed with SvelteKit (and deployed on Vercel).
With a built-in timer, it measures the speed of a baseball pitch based on the release and catch timing.
It supports both `km/h` and `mph` (`meters` and `feet`)

## Run it locally
Run the following command in your terminal:
```
cd myapp
npm install
npm run dev
```
## How to use the website
1. Configure the distance, and choose your units (meters or feet)
2. Press start as soon as the pitcher releases the ball from their hand
3. Press stop as soon as the ball reaches the catcher's glove
4. The resulting pitch would show in kmh or mph depending on your unit.
